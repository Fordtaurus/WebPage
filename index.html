Flashing lights, lights<br>
Flashing lights, lights<br>
Flashing lights, lights<br>
Flashing lights, lights<br>

<br>[Kanye West]<br>
She don't believe in shootin' stars,<br>
but she believe in shoes &amp; cars<br>
Wood floors in the new apartment,<br>
couture from the store's department<br>
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit,<br>
I'm more of the, trips to Florida<br>
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water<br>
Straight from the page of your favorite author<br>
And the weather so breezy,<br>
man why can't life always be this easy<br>
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,<br>
I get a call like where are you Yeezy<br>
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'<br>
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi<br>
Damn, these nigga's got me,<br>
I hate these nigga's more than the Nazis<br>

<br>[Dwele]<br>
As I recall, I know you love to show off<br>
But I never thought that you would take it this far<br>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br>

<br>[Kanye West]<br>
I know it's been a while,<br>
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing<br>
I know I was foul bay-bay,<br>
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,<br>
And if somebody would've told me a month ago<br>
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know<br>
If somebody would've told me a year ago<br>
it'd go, get this difficult<br>
Feeling like Katrina with no fema<br>
Like Martin with no Gina<br>
Like a flight with no visa<br>
First class with the seat back I still see ya<br>
In my past, you on the other side of the glass<br>
Of my memory's museum,<br>
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,<br>
come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar<br>

<br>[Dwele]<br>
As I recall, I know you love to show <br>
But I never thought that you would take it this far<br>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br>
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights<br>

As you recall, you know I love to show off<br>
But you never thought that I would take it this far<br>
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights<br>
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights<br>

Flashing lights, lights<br>
Flashing lights, lights<br>

<br>[Fade out]<br>
Lights, lights, lights, lights...
